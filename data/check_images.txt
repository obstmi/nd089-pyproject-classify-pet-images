Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No. While alexnet and vgg classified the dog to be a vizsla resp. hungarian pointer, 
resnet classified the dog to be a weimaraner (which looks similar to a vizsla). 
But no model architecure has found the right breed: Dachshund.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No. No model classified the same dog breed for both images. 
Both vgg and resnet identified the second image as an Italian greyhound (which is also not the correct breed), 
while alexnet did not classify any dog breed at all, but recognized a monkey in the image.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes. All three model architectures classified the non-dog-animal and the object correctly not to be dogs.
In all three cases, the animal was correctly classified as a cobra, while the object was recognized as a bicycle, 
but not as a racing bike.
